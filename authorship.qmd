# Authorship

::: callout-important
## Group Edit

Have a conversation with your group about guidelines and expectations around authorship and replace the text here.
Some ideas of things to discuss:

-   When/how often should conversations about authorship happen?

-   Read and discuss the [CRediT](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1210) and [MeRIT](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-37039-1) frameworks.

-   What potential conflicts are there regarding authorship and how will we manage them?
    (e.g. requirements of publishers vs. collaborator expectations)

-   Under what circumstances, if any, should authors be removed from a project?

-   Are there any circumstances where PI_NAME wouldn't be an author on a student/mentee paper?
