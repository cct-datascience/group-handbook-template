This is a work-in-progress, but will eventually be a template repo that contains a skeleton of a lab group handbook (much like the one described by [Tendler et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88853)).

## Things to edit

I'll turn this into instructions later, but here's a running list of things you'll need to edit after using this template:

-   Everything in \_variables.yml

-   `author:` in `_quarto.yml` (can't do lists with shortcodes)

-   `cover.png` and `cover-image` in `_quarto.yml` if you want a lab logo.
