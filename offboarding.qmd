# Offboarding

Offboarding is important to our group because we want to get feedback and also not lose your data and stuff

Steps to take:

1.  Make sure all of your code is in repositories in the {{< var group_name >}} GitHub organization
2.  Make sure each project has a README file explaining what it is, how to reproduce results, and includes metadata for any data collected (e.g. what do column names mean and what units are they in?)
3.  Schedule an exit interview
4.  More steps
