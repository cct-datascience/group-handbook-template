# Offboarding

::: callout-important
## Group Edit

This may be difficult to finalize until someone goes through the offboarding process and takes thorough notes (ideally by [editing](contributing.qmd) this page).
Here are some discussion topics to get you started though:

-   What are the group expectations for what to do with unpublished data collected during your time in the lab when you leave?

-   What about code used to analyze data?
    Where should it be stored and what are the expectations around reproducibility/usability of such code?

-   What kinds of keys (physical or otherwise) or passwords might someone need to pass on?

-   What kinds of shared drives does the lab group use?
    Do you need to explicitly transfer ownership of documents on any of them?

-   Are there official university or department offboarding steps to take?
    E.g. something mandated by HR or the graduate school like an exit interview?

-   What is the timeline for all of this?
    Don't wait until the last week of work to complete all these tasks!

Offboarding is important to our group because we want to get feedback and also not lose your data and stuff

Steps to take:

1.  Make sure all of your code is in repositories in the {{< var group_name >}} GitHub organization
2.  Make sure each project has a README file explaining what it is, how to reproduce results, and includes metadata for any data collected (e.g. what do column names mean and what units are they in?)
3.  Schedule an exit interview
4.  More steps...
